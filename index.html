<p class=sample5>Foot ball</p>
<p class=sample5>A football is a ball inflated with air that is used to play one of the various sports known as football. In these games, with some exceptions, goals or points are scored only when the ball enters one of two designated goal-scoring areas; football 
games involve the two teams each trying to move the ball in opposite
directions along the field of play.</p>
<p class=sample6>Baseball</p>

(a.k.a. roller hockey). They are all designed to serve the same function a ball does in ball games.</p>
